rt2x00-fw

This project aims to be a free implementation (with source code) of 
the firmware used by Ralink wireless chips. This firmware is required
by most cards that use the rt2x00usb drivers.

rt2x00-fw is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 2 of the License,
or (at your option) any later version.

Until August 2010, all GPL drivers released by Ralink contained one file with
a large binary array, certainly the firmware. This specific file was released 
under non-free terms, which explicitly avoided reverse engineering.

Since then, when RT8070/RT3070/RT3370 drivers series was released, it
seems that Ralink changed their mind and firmware.h now comes with a GPL
header. The binary arrays are identical, except for 6 bytes, to the 
previous RT2500USB(RT2571/RT2572) driver. Therefore, we assume that at
least all USB chips use basically the same firmware.

This project consists in disassembling, documenting and enhancing 
such firmware, rendering it into a de-facto piece of free software
and enabling users of this hardware to use it while keeping their
freedom.
