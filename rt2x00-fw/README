rt2x00-fw

This project aims to be a free implementation (with source code) of 
the firmware used by Ralink wireless chips. This firmware is required
by most cards that use the rt2x00usb drivers.

Until August 2010, all GPL drivers released by Ralink contained one file with
a large binary array, certainly the firmware. This specific file was released 
under non-free terms, which explicitly avoided reverse engineering.

Since then, when RT8070/RT3070/RT3370 drivers series was released, it
seems that Ralink changed their mind and firmware.h now comes with a GPL
header. The binary arrays are identical, except for 6 bytes, to the 
previous RT2500USB(RT2571/RT2572) driver. Therefore, we assume that at
least all USB chips use basically the same firmware.

This project consists in disassembling, documenting and enhancing 
such firmware, rendering it into a de-facto piece of free software
and enabling users of this hardware to use it while keeping their
freedom.
